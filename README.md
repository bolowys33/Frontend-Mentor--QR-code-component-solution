## My process

To kickstart the development process, I began by creating the HTML markup for the QR code component.

Moving on to the stylesheet, I took a systematic approach to styling the component. I focused on one component at a time, ensuring its visual appearance and functionality before moving on to the next.

Throughout the process, I maintained a keen eye for aesthetics and user experience, striving to create a visually pleasing and intuitive QR code component. By following this systematic and meticulous approach, I ensured that every aspect of the design was thoughtfully implemented.

During this project, I gained valuable insights and acquired new skills that significantly contributed to my growth as a frontend developer. One noteworthy accomplishment was mastering the art of creating cards with responsive images while preserving their aspect ratio.
